 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

⛳Overview

This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data. The dataset includes anonymized features and represents real-world credit card usage. The goal is to build a model that accurately flags suspicious transactions and helps in minimizing fraud-related losses.


🔎Objectives
→ Analyze and preprocess credit card transaction data.
→ Explore various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
→ Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score,).


📁 Dataset
→ The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset presents transactions that occurred over two days, where fraudulent transactions are highly imbalanced (492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions).

📋Libraries and tools are used in this project:
→ pandas – Data manipulation
→ numpy – Numerical computing
→ matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
→ scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation
